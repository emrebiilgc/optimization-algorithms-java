# optimization-algorithms-java

This project implements two algorithms in Java:

1. **Scroll Unlocking (Dynamic Programming)**  
   Maximizes the number of scrolls that can be collected within limited knowledge and time.

2. **Artifact Transportation (Greedy Programming)**  
   Minimizes the number of spaceships required to transport artifacts with limited capacity.

##  File Structure
- `Main.java` – Entry point of the program  
- `MaxScrollsDP.java` – Dynamic Programming solution for the scroll problem  
- `OptimalScrollSolution.java` – Helper class for DP solution  
- `MinShipsGP.java` – Greedy solution for the artifact transportation problem  
- `OptimalShipSolution.java` – Helper class for greedy solution
